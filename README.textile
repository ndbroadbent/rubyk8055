h1. RubyK8055

This is a ruby wrapper for the 'libk8055' linux driver, found here: "http://libk8055.sourceforge.net/":http://libk8055.sourceforge.net/
I highly recommend downloading and installing that driver first, and making sure that you can get your
K8055 board working under linux first.

h3. Compiling and Installing

* To compile the wrapper, you must have the 'libusb' (v 0.1.12 or lower) library installed.

bc. ruby extconf.rb
make
make install

* If you have the rspec gem installed, connect your K8055 and run the following, to test that the wrapper works with your K8055.

bc. spec rubyk8055_spec.rb

** Note: This will run *live* tests with your connected K8055 and make sure all the methods are doing what they are supposed to do.

* Run the following to test that you can load the wrapper:

bc. irb -r irb_test.rb

* The wrapper can then be accessed via the '@r' instance variable.

h3. Usage

bc. require 'rubyk8055'
include USB
r = RubyK8055.new
